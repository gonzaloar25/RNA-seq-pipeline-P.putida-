# RNA-seq-pipeline-P.putida-
An RNA-seq pipeline aimed at differential gene expression analysis in Pseudomonas putida

This pipeline has been tested on Linux Mint 21.3

Pipeline Structure:
The directory contains multiple scripts for preprocessing raw sequencing data, numbered according to their execution order.
Some steps are optional and can be skipped based on your specific needs.
A comprehensive R script for differential gene expression analysis is also provided.

Main Features:
Pre-processing of raw reads (quality control, trimming, filtering).
Alignment and quantification of gene expression.
Differential expression analysis using R.
